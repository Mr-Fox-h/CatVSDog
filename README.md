# Cat vs Dog AI Detection

## Overview

Welcome to the "Cat vs Dog" AI detection project! This repository contains code and a model for detecting cats and dogs using the Hugging Face dataset. The AI model is trained to distinguish between images of cats and dogs with high accuracy.

## Model Description

The AI model in this project is specifically designed to classify images as either cats or dogs. Leveraging the Hugging Face dataset, the model has been trained to recognize key features that differentiate between these two popular pets.

## Dataset

The model is trained on the Hugging Face dataset, which provides a diverse collection of images featuring cats and dogs. This dataset serves as the foundation for training the AI model to accurately identify and classify images of cats and dogs.

## Usage

Researchers, developers, and animal lovers alike can utilize this AI detection model for tasks such as image classification, object recognition, and pet identification. The model's ability to distinguish between cats and dogs can be applied in various scenarios where such classification is required.
